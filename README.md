# Hi, I'm Lu 👋

**Junior Data / AI Engineer · LLM & Cloud Enthusiast**

I'm a Burmese graduate based in Thailand, focusing on **LLMs, data engineering, and cloud**.  
I like turning ideas into real, working systems – from fine-tuning models to deploying full-stack apps on the cloud.

---

### 🔍 What I'm focused on right now

- Studying **AWS Cloud Practitioner** and planning the next AWS cert
- Building **LLM & RAG projects** (evaluation, fine-tuning, retrieval)
- Applying for **internships / junior roles** in data, AI, or cloud in Thailand
- Improving my **Python, SQL, and system design** skills

---

### 🧠 Highlights

- **LLM Fine-tuning & Evaluation (Senior Thesis)**  
  Fine-tuned a language model for **Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)** and **Aspect Sentiment Classification (ASC)** with strong improvements over baselines.

- **Book Publishing Platform – Full-stack Client Project**  
  Built an end-to-end platform for author → editor → publisher workflow, with  
  in-browser DOCX editing, real-time chat, e-commerce, semantic search, and AI-generated ads.

- **Anime Recommender with RAG & Monitoring**  
  Implemented a recommendation system using **RAG**, embeddings, Docker, GCP, and monitoring with Grafana.
